# RICorDE
a nice depths tool

## Installation
RICorDE is a standalone application built on QGIS python bindings.  Before using, ensure the following are installed:

- QGIS 3.22.8 (see the requirements.txt for dependencies shipped with QGIS)
- Whitebox.exe

RICorDE must be run within a working pyqgis development environment. To test if your environment is working, try the following:

`~python`

`>>>import qgis.core`

`>>>import processing`

If any of these result in an error, your environment is not set up correctly.
